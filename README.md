AIO Kubernetes installer (say no to minikube) which can be deployed on bare metal or VMs. 

## Supported platforms:

* Ansible 2.9
* Minimum 8 GB of RAM, 3 vCPUs and 25 GB od free disk for AIO demo
* bash
* ssh key pair already installed on the AIO host
* sudo passwordless on the AIO host (similar to cloud instances like in AWS or Openstack)
* kubectl client installed on Ansible controller

### Steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Edit the hosts inventory file, follow the template (specify private key file, desired hostname and IP address of the cluster interface)
3. On RPM/DNF based systems execute: `ansible-playbook -i hosts prerpm.yaml` then REBOOT
4. Execute: `ansible-playbook -i hosts install.yaml`
5. Playbook will retrieve kubeconfig file to current directory, you should have a matching version installation of kubectl client
6. (Optional) Execute `deployDashboard.sh` and use the printed token to access Kubernetes UI dashboard
6. (Optional) Execute `deployNginxIngress.sh` and use NGINX based Ingress with NodePort (bare metal style)

* Implement multi node cluster deployment
* Formal Documentation
